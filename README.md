# Script Auto Backups v3
### What's new?
1. I made the code better and cleaner, I think so :)
2. I added a check that the path you write will be entered into the file so for now the script saves the file and doesn't get the error like before
3. Now you can see when file was save, you can see it in console, When saves will work in console will output "Save 'Name of file' | Time: 00:00:00"

### How to use?
1. Install exe file from folder 'output' or download the code
2. Run it
3. Write a path to file
4. Write the interval between saves
5. Press enter and that's it
